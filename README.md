  <strong>Stop hunting through grouped windows. Click once, get exactly what you need.</strong>
</p>

A macOS menu bar application that creates individual dock icons for your application windows — because macOS groups all your windows together, but your brain doesn't work that way.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

You have 5 VSCode projects open. Or 3 Xcode workspaces. Or multiple terminal sessions. **macOS groups them all under one dock icon.**

Now you need that specific project window. So you:
1. Click the dock icon
2. Scan through the "Show All Windows" popup
3. Find your window (maybe)
4. Click again

**Every. Single. Time.**

## ✨ The Solution

WindowsOnDock gives each window its own dock icon. **One click. Done.**

No more hunting. No more window juggling. Just click the dock icon for the project you want, and it's instantly in front of you.

## 🚀 Key Benefits

- **📍 Direct Access** - Click once to bring up exactly the window you need
- **🎨 Visual Clarity** - Each helper shows the correct app icon, so you know what you're clicking
- **⚡ Fast Switching** - No more navigating through window groups or Mission Control
- **🎛️ Customizable** - Choose which apps to monitor in Preferences
- **🧹 Clean & Simple** - Add or remove helpers with a few clicks

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Download Release (Recommended)

1. Download `WindowsOnDock.zip` from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Unzip and move `WindowsOnDock.app` to your Applications folder
3. Launch WindowsOnDock
4. Grant Accessibility permissions when prompted

### Option 2: Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WindowsOnDock.git
cd WindowsOnDock
open WindowsOnDock.xcodeproj
# Press ⌘R to build and run
```

## 🎮 How to Use

### Adding Windows to Your Dock

1. **Launch WindowsOnDock** - Look for the grid icon in your menu bar
2. **Open "Manage Window Helpers"** (⌘M)
3. **Select windows** you want dock icons for
4. **Click "Add to Dock"**

That's it! Your dock will restart and the helper icons appear.

### Using Your Helpers

Simply **click any helper icon in the dock** and that specific window instantly comes to the front.

### Removing Helpers

1. Open "Manage Window Helpers"
2. Select helpers to remove
3. Click "Remove from Dock"

Or use **"Clear All Helpers"** from the menu bar to remove everything at once.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `⌘M` - Manage Window Helpers
- `⌘,` - Preferences
- `⌘A` - Select all windows (in management view)
- `⌘Q` - Quit (auto-removes all helpers)

## 🎛️ Supported Applications

WindowsOnDock works with:

- **Code Editors**: VSCode, Xcode, Sublime Text, JetBrains IDEs
- **Terminals**: iTerm, Terminal
- **Office Apps**: Word, PowerPoint, Excel

## 🤖 AI-Generated Project

This project was **mostly generated by AI** ([Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)) with human guidance. It demonstrates what's possible when you combine:
- Human product vision
- AI implementation capability
- Iterative refinement

The icon, code architecture, UI, and even this README were created through AI-human collaboration.

## 🛠️ How It Works

Since macOS has no public API for adding arbitrary dock items, WindowsOnDock creates minimal `.app` bundles that appear as real applications:

1. **Monitor** - Scans for application windows every 2 seconds using the Accessibility API
2. **Create** - Generates helper apps in `~/Library/Application Support/WindowsOnDock/Helpers/`
3. **Register** - Adds helpers to dock using `defaults write com.apple.dock`
4. **Activate** - When clicked, helpers use AppleScript to raise their target window

Each helper contains:
- Bash script with embedded AppleScript
- Parent application's icon
- Window title metadata

## ⚙️ Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Accessibility permissions (required to read window titles and activate windows)

## 🔒 Privacy

WindowsOnDock runs **100% locally** on your Mac:
- ✅ No data collection
- ✅ No network access
- ✅ No analytics or tracking
- ✅ Only uses Accessibility API for window management

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Helpers match windows by title. If you rename a project significantly, recreate the helper
- Rebuilding during development may require re-granting Accessibility permissions
- Window titles must remain relatively stable for helpers to work
